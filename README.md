## README Template Repo
Created a place to store information about writing a good README. I will also use this location to store various templates I will use for future projects.

## Motivation
I have never been great at documentation on my own (who has?). So I built this repo to help foster that mindset of creating great easy to read and follow documentation.

## Code style
Simple GitHub based markdown

## Screenshots
TBD

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>

I am new to this and likely missing some good features or industry standards so I am very open to all additions (and redactions).
